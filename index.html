                        “Creative thinking inspires ideas. Ideas inspire change” - Barbara Januszkiewicz. TED is a nonprofit media organization devoted
                        to spreading ideas. It is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture
                        who seek a deeper understanding of the world. The power of ideas can change attitudes, lives and
                        ultimately the world. Starting in 1984, TED Talks continue to be watched around the world, with an
                        average of 17 new page views a second. TED conferences and events continue to inspire, motivate and
                        thrill attendees.

                        TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by any inspiring and enthusiastic organizers with a license
                        from TED. TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, 'ideas worth spreading'. It supports independent
                        organizers who want to create a TED-like event in their own community. It is designed to help communities,
                        organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences.
                        Here a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos —
                        sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx has reached a checkpoint of 100,000
                        talks recently.

                directions on where to turn. It is a maze where every decision we make takes us in a
                different direction and every time we turn one way we could just as easily have turned the
                other. There has never been a better word than "The journey is always as beautiful as the
                destination." to describe the path through the labyrinth we call life. Every person we meet,
                or turn we make, plays a significant role in steering us to our destination. 2018 was an
                eventful year and it showed us that life altering events often come unannounced, but we
                don't have to deal with them alone. There is no event too big nor any turn too wrong that
                cannot be made right with the right people to explore and unravel the mysteries of life with.</p>

                        Mr. Piyush Shinde is a strategic sales, marketing and communications expert, providing efficient and successful business solutions and innovative strategies to various organizations and companies worldwide. With affinity to behavioural science, human psychology, and also his personal tryst with failures despite giving it all, made him think deep and paved the way for development of a novel concept called the “Thought Matrix”, that categorises all of us into four different personalities based on how each one of us reacts to opportunities. Using the Thought Matrix and its reflections he has constantly created opportunities when others around him failed to see them.
